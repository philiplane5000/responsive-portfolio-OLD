            <p> &nbsp; Hi! Thanks for visiting my personal web portfolio. To peek at my finished work or preview what is to come
                please visit my personal gallery page or get in touch using the links above.
                <br>
                <br> A little bit about me: Due to the nature of my parents' work as a UN civil servant and teacher, I was fortunate
                to have grown up internationally, moving from country to country every few years. I particulary loved our
                time spent living in the wonderful nation of Sri Lanka which was our home base through my most formative
                years before moving to San Diego to attend
                <abbr title="University of San Diego">USD</abbr>.
                <br>
                <br> While an undergraduate student at
                <abbr title="University of San Diego">USD</abbr> I pursued a liberal arts degree in 'Ethnic Studies' and 'History'.
                <!-- I've since served as a volunteer coordinator for a non-profit agency serving refugees in San Diego, worked as an English teacher in Thailand, participated in other service-oriented activities, and continue to explore meaningful or fun opportunities. <br> <br> -->

                Most recently, I discovered a passion for coding and web development which I continue to pursue as a student of
                <abbr title="University of California, San Diego">UCSD</abbr> Extension School's Coding Bootcamp!
                <br>
                <br> Hobbies/interests of mine include: playing soccer, surfing, gardening, CODING, and camping.
                <br>
